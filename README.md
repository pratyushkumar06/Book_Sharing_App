Progress Of the App
- Authentication Part Completed.Firestore Doesn't Support Index search Querying so I tried Using Algolia but I found out that the Spark plan on Firebase (the free-tier that I was using) doesn't allow outbound requests to 3rd-party APIs like Algolia so I couldn't implement the search Feature.
- Users can upload information about the book with the details and a picture.
- Users have to setup their Profile with a Picture and Name.
- The uploaded books can be viewed by the user in the home feed along with details of the book and user who uploaded it.
- Other Users can comment on the book post made by a user the comments are visible to everyone using the app.
- On the Account Feed user can see the book posts that he made and he can delete his posts too.
- Added the Cart function where the user can add books to his personal cart and remove when they want.
